# KNN-TITANIC-PROJECT-SPAM-MAIL-PREDICTION
This repository contains two Jupiter Notebooks. The contain the models I have built to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived and whether an email is spam or ham.

## Description
This repository contains a Jupiter notebook that contains Python code that I used to build two machine learning models.
The first model is built using Naive Bayes algorithm. This model is expected to predict whether an email is spam or ham.
The second model is built using K- Nearest Neighbours algorithm. This model is expected to predict whether or not a passenger
survived the titanic disaster.
My findings are well explained in the notebooks. You may jump right into the conclusions at the end of the notebook to get a summary of my findings.

## Experimental design
- Read and explore the given dataset
- Define the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question
- Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis.
- Build models using the following:
    * Naive Bayes Classifier
    * K- Nearest Neighbours 
- Challenge the solution.
- Make conclusions

## Setup Instructions
To make changes to my code, you can go ahead and fork my work.
